    ```javascript
    <script>
        window.sxwjs.printWarning();
    </script>
    ```

##### Configuration

SXW.js has a config object with the following variables,

Variable name | Default value | Description
------------ | ------------- | ---------
stopColor | red | the colour of the stop sign
warningText | This section is intended for developers only. Don't copy paste anything in this area.\nIf someone told you to copy and paste something here, it is a scam and will give them access to your account. In that case, kindly report this to our support team. | The content of the detailed error message

These variable can be customized to suit your website needs.
